 ## Frequently Asked Questions  ##

### Where can I add image sizes ? ####
Go to Settings -> Media then you can add a image size. You have to add a unique custom name without any spaces or special chars.
The best is to use something like my-custom-size.
Then you have several fields for configuring the image size, the widht, the height, cropping.
And then you can choose if the image is displayed on the media insertion or not ( this will be displayed on the dropdown list ).
